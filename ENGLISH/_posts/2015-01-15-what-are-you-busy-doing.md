I'm so busy these days that I can hardly do the things that I like to in my spare time. 

Actually I have almost no spare time lately due to my business. The start of the new year has been busy for me doing things like summarising, planning, having discussions, and doing statistics. What's more, an intern arrived a few days ago. I have been training him in his current work most of the time. What's more, I'm going to give a lecture to our group about the practice of Deep Learning tomorrow afternoon. 

Later, when I checked my courses on Coursera, I found the deadlines approaching on a few courses that I am behind in. Totally a mess! Sometimes when I feel stressed with overwhelming things to do, I will set them aside and rest first. However, after having a conversation about the time segments with my friends, I began to think about whether I have made good use of my time. So I try to ask myself, 

> What am I busy doing? Can I work more efficiently and more productively so that I could make room for my hobbies? Was it all worth it? If not, how about cutting out those unimportant things to save time?"
