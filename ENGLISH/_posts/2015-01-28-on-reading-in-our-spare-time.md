Tonight some friends and I talked about reading in our spare time. 

What a pity when I realised that it has been a long time since I last read a book in a comfortable afternoon, drinking a cup of Longjin Tea under the warm sun.

I ever enjoyed reading very much, but as I graduated and then work overwhelmingly, I have less and less time to do some reading. What's worse, I'm nearly losing the habit of reading in my spare time. That is, previously I would unconsciously pick up a book to read when I had nothing to do, but now I would prefer to other things unawarely.  

As Bacon said,

> studies serve for ornament, for delight and for ability, while reading is just a very kind of studies. It has brought me a lot of pleasure, knowledge and capability. 

So it is high time to re-establish the habit of reading.
