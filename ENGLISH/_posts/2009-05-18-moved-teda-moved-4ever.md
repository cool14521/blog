so drunk here. actually, yesterday is my birthday in solar calendar. coz my business in CH, there's no such a getting together yesterday. with cake and presents, a bundle of lovely guys celebrated the day, moving me deeply. 3q as i said, je vous aime tous. gradually,i understand Y those American always say i love U or French say j'aime, with a thanks-giving heart,they express themselves whenever they're moved. As the new American Bible goes “I love those who love me. And those who diligently seek me will find me”. under the rose i prayed my wishes,one 4 my private emotional affairs, one 4 those guys. the rest one is 4 my financial independence. if U're le petit prince of someone, u'll cherish Ur rose. i'd cherish everyone who.la.me!
