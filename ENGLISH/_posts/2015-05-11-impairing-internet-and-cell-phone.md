The emergence and evolvement of Internet and electronic devices bring us a convenient and efficient era, but meanwhile, I dare say, they have somehow weakened the face-to-face communication skills among people. The extent to which communication between people are impaired will be described and explained below.

Due to the cell phone addiction in our Internet era, such as twittering, instantly messaging, or surfing the Internet, it is widely acknowledged that people sometimes become reluctant to respond to, indifferent to and even ignorant about other people in a friends gathering. Cell phone addiction much different from handling with an emergency via a cell phone, under which situation if someone beg his/her pardon after their conversation is interrupted others would understand, make it disrespectful and even brutal, which seems these people are undoubtedly incapable of mastering the situation and they would probably fail to fulfil the purpose of gathering, that is, to strengthen the relationship and to enhance the intimacy. Even at home, without an intent as friends gathering’s, cell phone addiction could also prevents family members from regular communication, since the addiction would unavoidably reduce the time and opportunity to chat with one’s family members.

So switch off the cell phone and dedicatedly to talk to the ones beside you.
