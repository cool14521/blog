“Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs. Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, a choking gall and a preserving sweet. "-- Romeo and Juliet (Act I, Scene I)  
“See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O! that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek."--- Romeo and Juliet (Act II, Scene II)  
"Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow.  That I shall say good night till it be morrow."--- Romeo and Juliet (Act II, Scene II)  
"Doubt thou the stars are fire; doubt that the sun doth move, doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt I love".-- From Hamlet (Act II, Scene II)  
"What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet."-- Romeo and Juliet (Act II, Scene II)  
Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage.
