I knew the chinese form from KF Lee.And it always helps me out.  
Here's the best-known form:  


    "God, grant me
    the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
    Courage to change the things I can,
    And wisdom to know the difference."

  
Besides,the origin form is :  


    O God and Heavenly Father,Grant to us
    the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed;
    courage to change that which can be changed,
    and wisdom to know the one from the other,
    through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
