circle,endless.what a ridiculous but self-evident statement it seemed to be.  
but truth is,U got complex,you got sleeplessness,U made things complicated,U messed yourself up.then your just put them into a circle,which obviously becomed endless.it's just like a piano with so many keys that U could't play,as 1900 said. it made U sick,then weak.no one knows Y U love Daodao,no one knows Y U learn French,no one knows Y U're on such geek behavior staying up late,no one knows Y...and the riddle had never been solved.no one seeing it,it might be ghost.  
"So dim,so dark, so dense, so dull, so damp, so dank, so dead."U were just looking for a face,hunting 4 a voice,did any sign mean sth or just nothing.no sign,U sigh.mystery 2 history.(just in the B/S pattern,there's no response even an exception,which drived U crazy.maybe the connection hadn't ever been established,for instance,the server hadn't recieved the request.)  
"Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow.  That I shall say good night till it be morrow."U might not understand Y some guys always C G'night or dors bien.they were geeks.they stayed up later just to confirm they'd C the words right time.  
damn it,the circle was still incurably circling....![Image 1][]
