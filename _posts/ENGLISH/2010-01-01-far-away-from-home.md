The furthest distance in the world  
Is not when I stand in front of you  
Yet you can't see my love  
But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both  
Yet cannot  
Be together.  
The furthest distance in the world  
Is not being apart while being in love  
But when plainly can not resist the yearning  
Yet pretending YOU have never been in my heart.
