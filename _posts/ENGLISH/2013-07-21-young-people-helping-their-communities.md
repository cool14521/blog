With the development of the Internet, young people are more involved in the online communities, which gives them a new environment to communicate with each other and to give others a hand. Though they are unlike the the conventional communities, online communities are more active than traditional ones and it is more convenient for young people to dedicate their energy and time to those communities.

First of all, recent years have seen the thriving of online communities such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. It is reported that the number of Facebook users goes up to one billion, and most of the users are young people. In addition, Google Plus and Twitter's systems are similar to Facebook's. With so many user online, people could keep touch with others much more conveniently and more instantly, which could not be imagined by people one hundred years ago.

Furthermore, with the development of communication technology, young people can easily connect to the Internet just with a cellphone wherever they are and whenever it is. Thus, it is possible for young people to ask for help. For example, last semester, my girlfriend lost her watch on campus and she didn't know where she lost it. Then she posted a request for help in the online community of our university. The next day, to her surprise, the watch was found and was returned to her. 

Finally, young people in the online communities are active and tend to give help, since young people are energetic at making new friends, especially by online. Take my self as an example, I took part in one a programming group of Facebook, called Functional Programming. There were so many active members that every time I consulted a problem when I was learning Scala, one of the functional programming languages, they gave me a hand patiently and deliberately.

All in all, it is a good idea to turn to online communities for help.
